// Peer Review: Super Clean Design. JS and HTML code also look pretty clean too.
    Critiques:
    -For the determining winner logic you probably could've done a less taxing method using switch statements or a dictionary of some kind. 
    -Some sort of indicator in the game would be nice after both players or the player and cpu have both chosen their hands, simply showing a score tick up I don't think is enough and I was confused for a sec.
    -Also you should change the title from Bootstrap Demo to something else
    
    - The simple, futuristic design is really impressive though. It catches the eye and makes the overall project fun. Good stuff
